# Video Capture SDK .Net - VNC Source Demo (WPF, cross-platform engine)

This SDK sample demonstrates the integration of the VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net into a WPF application for capturing video from a VNC source.

It initializes the VisioForge SDK, sets up video capture with error handling, and allows for starting and stopping the video capture process. The code includes a UI with buttons to control the capture process and fields for configuring the VNC source settings, such as host, port, URL, and password. It also demonstrates the use of asynchronous programming to manage the video capture lifecycle and the disposal of resources.

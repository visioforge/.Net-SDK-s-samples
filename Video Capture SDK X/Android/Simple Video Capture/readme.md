# VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net

## Simple Video Capture Demo (Android)

This SDK sample demonstrates a simple Android application for video capturing using the VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net.

The `MainActivity` class, which serves as the main activity, initializes the video capture environment, handles camera and audio device enumeration, and supports starting and stopping video recording.

It includes user interface elements for recording control, such as start and stop buttons, and a switch camera button to toggle between available video sources.

The application also manages permissions for camera access, audio recording, and file storage, ensuring a seamless user setup before capturing videos.

This example showcases the integration of VisioForge's powerful video capture capabilities into an Android application, enabling developers to implement custom video recording features with ease.

## Supported frameworks

* .Net 7

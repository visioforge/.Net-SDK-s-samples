# VisioForge Video Edit SDK .Net

## Simple Video Player Avalonia Demo

This SDK sample demonstrates how to create a video from a collection of images using the VisioForge Video Edit SDK .Net in a console application.

The program scans a specified folder for images with common formats (JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF), then arranges them sequentially to produce a video file.

Users can customize output settings such as resolution, format (MP4, AVI, WMV), and frame rate. The application supports command-line arguments for easy automation and integration into larger workflows. Error handling and progress reporting are included to ensure a smooth operation.

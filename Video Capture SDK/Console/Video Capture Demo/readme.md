# Video Capture SDK .Net - Video Capture Demo CLI (C#/Console)

This sample code demonstrates the use of the VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net to create a console application that captures video and audio from selected devices. Users can choose from available video capture devices, select video and audio formats, and specify the frame rate.

The program offers the option to capture the media either in AVI or MP4 format, based on the user's selection. Additionally, it handles errors gracefully, displaying them to the console without interrupting the capture process. This example is a straightforward demonstration of integrating video and audio capture functionalities into applications using VisioForge's SDK.

# VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net

## Multiple IP Cameras Demo (C#/WPF)

The "Multiple IP Cameras Demo WPF" sample demonstrates how to integrate multiple IP camera feeds into a single WPF application using the VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net.

It features asynchronous initialization of a video capture engine, allowing for the capture and preview of video streams from up to four IP cameras simultaneously.

Users can select different source engines (e.g., VLC, FFMPEG, RTSP Low Latency) for each camera feed, adjust ONVIF support, and toggle preview or recording modes.

The application includes error handling to log issues during capture and provides a clean-up mechanism to dispose of resources upon closing, showcasing best practices for resource management in .NET applications.

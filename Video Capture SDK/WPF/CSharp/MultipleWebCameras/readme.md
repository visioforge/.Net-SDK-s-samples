# VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net

## Multiple Web Cameras Demo (C#/WPF)

The sample demonstrates how to integrate and control multiple web cameras within a single application using the VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net.

This example showcases the initialization and disposal of two video capture instances, `VideoCapture1` and `VideoCapture2`, within a WPF application.

It includes asynchronous start and stop methods for each camera, error handling through event subscription, and UI interaction to select camera devices and display video previews.

The code provides a practical example of managing multiple video capture sources, adjusting video capture settings for optimal performance, and handling possible errors during video capture operations.

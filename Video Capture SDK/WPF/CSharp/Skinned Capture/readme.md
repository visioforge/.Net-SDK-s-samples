# VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net

## Skinned Video Capture Demo (C#/WPF)

The SDK sample demonstrates how to implement a skinned video capture application using VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net in a WPF environment.

The application showcases the integration of custom skins for the user interface, handling of basic window commands (minimize, maximize, restore, close), and video capture functionalities, including switching between cameras, toggling fullscreen mode, and applying video effects.

The code also emphasizes event handling for video capture errors and the implementation of a `Dispose` pattern for resource management. This example is a comprehensive guide for developers looking to incorporate video capture capabilities with a customizable UI in their .NET applications.

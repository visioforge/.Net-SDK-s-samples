# Video Capture SDK .Net - Video preview from a webcam code snippet (C#/WinForms)

This sample demonstrates how to build a basic webcam preview application using the VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net in a Windows Forms application. The code showcases how to initialize the video capture engine, enumerate available video and audio capture devices, and configure them for preview.

It includes event handling for starting, stopping, pausing, and resuming the video stream, as well as dynamically adjusting video and audio settings based on user selection.

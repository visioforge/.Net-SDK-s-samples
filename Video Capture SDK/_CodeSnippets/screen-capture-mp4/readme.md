# Video Capture SDK .Net - Screen capture to MP4 code snippet (C#/WinForms)

This SDK sample demonstrates how to use the VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net to create a simple screen recording application in C#. The application features two main functionalities: capturing the screen with audio and capturing the screen without audio, both outputting the result as an MP4 file.

It initializes the video capture component, configures screen capture settings for full-screen recording, selects an audio device for recording (if needed), and controls the start and stop of the recording process asynchronously. The example showcases the ease of setting up screen capture, audio capture, and output file configurations using the VisioForge SDK.

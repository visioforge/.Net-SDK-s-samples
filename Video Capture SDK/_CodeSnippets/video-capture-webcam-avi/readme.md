# Video Capture SDK .Net - Video capture to AVI code snippet (C#/WinForms)

This SDK sample demonstrates the implementation of a basic webcam video capture application using VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net in a Windows Forms application. The code initializes the `VideoCaptureCore` object, sets up the default video and audio sources, and specifies the output file format and location.

Users can start and stop video capture with the click of a button, capturing video from the webcam and saving it as an AVI file with MJPEG video compression and PCM audio.

This example showcases how to use the VisioForge library to capture video from hardware devices, configure capture settings, and manage the capture process asynchronously.

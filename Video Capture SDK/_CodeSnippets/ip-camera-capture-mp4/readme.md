# Video Capture SDK .Net - IP camera capture to MP4 code snippet (C#/WinForms)

This SDK sample demonstrates how to capture video streams from IP cameras and save them as MP4 files using the VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net.

The example code, written in C#, sets up a simple Windows Forms application to connect to an IP camera using its URL, configure video without audio capture, and record the video stream to the user's "My Videos" folder.

It includes functionality to start and stop video capture asynchronously, showcasing the use of the VisioForge API for video capture tasks, including setting the video source to an IP camera, specifying the output format, and controlling the capture session with start and stop methods.

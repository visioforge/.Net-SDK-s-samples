# VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net

## IP Capture Demo (C#/WinForms)

The sample demonstrates a comprehensive example of integrating IP camera functionalities into a .NET application using the VisioForge Video Capture SDK .Net. This demo showcases how to capture video from IP cameras, including support for ONVIF cameras, various output formats (MP4, AVI, WMV, GIF, etc.), hardware acceleration, and video effects.

Users can interact with the camera's PTZ controls (if available), configure video and audio settings through dialogues, and manage network source disconnect events. Additionally, it features recording to a file with selected codecs and formats, taking screenshots, and adjusting video properties like brightness, contrast, and saturation on the fly.

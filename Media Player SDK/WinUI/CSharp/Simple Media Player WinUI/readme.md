# Media Player SDK .Net - Simple Video Player Demo (C#/WinUI)

This WinUI 3 desktop application showcases the integration of the VisioForge Media Player SDK .NET. It features a user-friendly interface for playing, pausing, resuming, and stopping video playback. Users can open video files using the FileOpenPicker, and control playback through a slider that adjusts the video position.

The application also includes a custom video background setting and periodically updates the UI to reflect the current playback position and duration. It demonstrates handling media files, implementing a DispatcherTimer for UI updates, and managing app window properties, such as resizing and setting icons, using WinUI and Windows App SDK APIs.

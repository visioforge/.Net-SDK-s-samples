# Media Player SDK .Net - Two Windows Demo (C#/WinForms)

This SDK sample demonstrates how to create a multimedia application using the VisioForge Media Player SDK .NET. The application features two windows: the main window (`Form1`) for controlling media playback (play, pause, stop, resume, adjust volume/balance, and navigate through the timeline) and a secondary window (`Form2`) for displaying video.

It showcases the use of the `MediaPlayerCore` class to handle media playback, including setting up a playlist, looping playback, adjusting audio settings, and managing multi-screen setups. The code also illustrates handling user interactions, such as file selection and adjusting playback settings through the UI. The application logs errors and supports debugging modes for troubleshooting.

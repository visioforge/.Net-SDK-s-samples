# Media Player SDK .Net - Memory Playback code snippet (C#/WinForms)

This SDK sample demonstrates the integration of VisioForge's media playback capabilities into a Windows Forms application. It showcases how to open a video file, read the file into a byte array, and then play it directly from memory using VisioForge's MediaPlayerCore.

The sample includes handling both audio and video streams, checking for their availability, and setting appropriate playback settings.

It leverages VisioForge's capabilities for memory stream playback, demonstrating how to create a ManagedIStream from a MemoryStream containing the video file's data and then initiating playback within the MediaPlayerCore instance.

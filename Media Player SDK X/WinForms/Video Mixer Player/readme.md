# Media Player SDK .Net - Video Mixer Player Demo (WinForms, cross-platform SDK engine)

This SDK sample demonstrates the creation of a video mixing and playback application using the VisioForge Live Video Compositor engine within a Windows Forms application. The code initializes the SDK, manages video and audio sources, and controls playback through a timeline.

It allows adding video files as sources dynamically through a file dialog, adjusting their positions on the timeline, and displaying the mixed output in a video renderer. Users can monitor and manipulate the playback position and duration of the sources in real-time.

The application also handles SDK initialization and disposal to ensure proper resource management.

# Media Blocks SDK .Net - macOS Simple Player Demo

The SimpleMediaPlayerMBMac SDK sample demonstrates the integration of VisioForge's Media Blocks SDK for creating a media player application on macOS. It showcases how to initialize and manage a media playback pipeline, including video and audio rendering, using `MediaBlocksPipeline`, `VideoRendererBlock`, and `AudioRendererBlock`. The application supports loading and playing various media formats, updating a playback position with a slider, and displaying video within a custom OpenGL view. Essential UI interactions for starting, stopping, and opening media files are also implemented, demonstrating asynchronous task handling and UI updates on macOS.

To add cross-platform image assets for your Uno Platform app, use the Assets folder
in the shared project instead. Resources in this folder are Android-only.

Images, layout descriptions, binary blobs and string dictionaries can be included 
in your application as resource files.  Various Android APIs are designed to 
operate on the resource IDs instead of dealing with images, strings or binary blobs 
directly.

For example, a sample Android app that contains a user interface layout (main.axml),
an internationalization string table (strings.xml) and some icons (drawable-XXX/icon.png) 
would keep its resources in the "Resources" directory of the application:

Resources/
    drawable/
        icon.png

    layout/
        main.axml

    values/
        strings.xml

Each of these directories and files has a specific meaning in Android resource system.

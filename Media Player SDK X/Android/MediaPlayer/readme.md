# Media Player SDK .Net - Android Simple Player Demo

This SDK sample demonstrates the integration of VisioForge's MediaPlayerCoreX with `Xamarin.Android` to create a versatile media player application. It showcases handling user interactions to control media playback, including picking media files using Xamarin.Essentials' `FilePicker`, updating playback position with a seek bar and displaying current playback time.

# VisioForge Video Edit SDK .Net

## Video From Images X CLI Demo

This SDK sample demonstrates how to create a video from a collection of images using VisioForge Video Edit SDK .Net in a console application.

The program scans a specified directory for image files of various formats (JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIF), and then sequentially adds them to a video file with customizable output settings such as video size, frame rate, and format (MP4, AVI, WMV).

The process involves initializing the video editor, configuring video properties, adding images as video frames, setting the output format, and handling events for progress, error, and completion. The sample includes command-line argument parsing for flexible input and output configuration.

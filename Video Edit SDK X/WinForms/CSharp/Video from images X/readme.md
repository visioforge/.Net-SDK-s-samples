# VisioForge Video Edit SDK .Net

## Video From Images Demo (C#/WinForms, cross-platform engine)

This sample demonstrates how to use the VisioForge Video Edit SDK .Net to create a video from a series of images.

It showcases the initialization of the `VideoEditCoreX` engine, adding images as input files, configuring output parameters like video size and frame rate, and handling events such as progress updates and errors.

The UI includes options to select input images, adjust video settings, and start or stop the video creation process. Additionally, the sample provides a way to view video tutorials and specifies how to handle the application's closure by properly disposing of the SDK resources.

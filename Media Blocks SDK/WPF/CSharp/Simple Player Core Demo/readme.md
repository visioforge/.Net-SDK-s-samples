# Media Blocks SDK .Net - Simple Player Demo (WPF)

The Simple Player Core engine sample, part of the VisioForge Media Blocks SDK .Net, is a comprehensive example showcasing how to build a media player using the VisioForge framework. This sample application demonstrates initializing the SDK, managing media playback (including play, pause, stop, and resume actions), handling user interactions for selecting media files, and adjusting playback settings like volume and stream selection.

# Media Blocks SDK .Net - Simple Player Demo (WPF)

The sample demonstrates the integration of the VisioForge Media Blocks SDK .Net within a WPF application to create a simple media player. It showcases how to initialize the SDK, create a media pipeline with audio and video rendering blocks, and handle media source files. The application features a UI for selecting a file, controlling playback (start, stop, pause, resume), adjusting volume, and displaying the current playtime alongside the total duration of the media.

This example highlights the SDK's capabilities for custom media player development, including error handling and asynchronous operations for an enhanced user experience.

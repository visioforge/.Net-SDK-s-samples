# Media Blocks SDK .Net - Live Video Compositor Demo (WPF)

This SDK sample demonstrates the use of the Live Video Compositor (part of Media Blocks SDK .Net) for creating a live video mixing application. It includes functionality to add and manage video and audio sources, such as cameras, files, and screen captures, as well as outputs like MP4, WebM, MP3, and Decklink devices. The application allows for real-time composition of multiple sources into a single output stream, featuring UI controls for source configuration, output management, and recording control.

# Media Blocks SDK .Net - Face Detector Live Demo (WPF)

This SDK sample demonstrates the implementation of a live face detection and blurring application using the VisioForge Media Blocks SDK .Net. The application initializes a media pipeline, capturing video input from a selected device, and offers the user the choice between detecting faces or blurring them in real-time. It features a responsive UI that updates with information about detected faces and provides controls for selecting video input devices, formats, and frame rates. Additionally, it includes error handling and logging capabilities, illustrating a robust approach to integrating VisioForge's media processing technologies into a WPF application for enhanced video processing tasks.

# Build a Cross-Platform HLS Streaming App with .NET MAUI and VisioForge Media Blocks SDK

## TL;DR
Learn how to create a modern HLS streaming application that runs on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows using .NET MAUI and the VisioForge Media Blocks SDK. This guide includes complete source code and explains how to implement adaptive bitrate streaming, live stream support, and professional media player controls.

## Why HLS Streaming Matters in 2025

HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) has become the de facto standard for video streaming across the internet. Originally developed by Apple, it's now supported by virtually every platform and device. If you're building a streaming app today, HLS support is non-negotiable.

## What We're Building

We're creating a fully-featured HLS streaming player with:
- üé• Support for both VOD and live streams
- üì± Native performance on all platforms
- üéÆ Professional playback controls
- üìä Real-time stream information display
- üîä Volume control and seeking capabilities
- üåê Pre-configured sample streams for testing

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with MAUI workload
- VisioForge Media Blocks SDK license (trial available)
- Basic knowledge of C# and XAML

## The Tech Stack

### VisioForge Media Blocks SDK
The Media Blocks SDK provides a high-level pipeline architecture for media processing. Think of it as LEGO blocks for media - you connect sources, transforms, and renderers to build complex media workflows.

### Why Media Blocks for HLS?
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Automatic GPU decoding on all platforms
- **GStreamer Backend**: Battle-tested media framework under the hood
- **Unified API**: Same code works on iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS
- **HLS Features**: Adaptive bitrate, live streams, DRM support

## Implementation Deep Dive

### 1. Setting Up the Media Pipeline

The core of our HLS player is the media pipeline. Here's how we set it up:

```csharp
private async Task CreateEngineAsync(string hlsUrl)
{
    // Create the pipeline
    _pipeline = new MediaBlocksPipeline();
    
    // Create HLS source with automatic format detection
    var sourceSettings = await UniversalSourceSettings.CreateAsync(
        new Uri(hlsUrl),
        renderVideo: true,
        renderAudio: true
    );
    
    _source = new UniversalSourceBlockMini(sourceSettings);
    
    // Create renderers
    var videoView = videoView.GetVideoView();
    _videoRenderer = new VideoRendererBlock(_pipeline, videoView);
    _audioRenderer = new AudioRendererBlock();
    
    // Connect the pipeline
    _pipeline.Connect(_source.VideoOutput, _videoRenderer.Input);
    _pipeline.Connect(_source.AudioOutput, _audioRenderer.Input);
}
```

### 2. The MAUI User Interface

Our UI is built with XAML and provides a Netflix-like experience:

```xml
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:my="clr-namespace:VisioForge.Core.UI.MAUI;assembly=VisioForge.Core.UI.MAUI">
    <Grid>
        <!-- HLS URL Input -->
        <Entry x:Name="txtHLSUrl" 
               Text="https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8"
               Placeholder="Enter HLS stream URL..." />
        
        <!-- Video Player -->
        <my:VideoView x:Name="videoView"
                      Background="Black"/>
        
        <!-- Playback Controls -->
        <Slider x:Name="slSeeking" ValueChanged="slSeeking_ValueChanged" />
        <Button x:Name="btConnect" Text="CONNECT" Clicked="btConnect_Clicked" />
    </Grid>
</ContentPage>
```

### 3. Handling Live vs VOD Streams

One key challenge is differentiating between live and on-demand content:

```csharp
private void _pipeline_OnStart(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    MainThread.BeginInvokeOnMainThread(async () =>
    {
        var duration = await _pipeline.DurationAsync();
        if (duration.TotalMilliseconds > 0)
        {
            // VOD content - enable seeking
            slSeeking.Maximum = duration.TotalMilliseconds;
            slSeeking.IsEnabled = true;
        }
        else
        {
            // Live stream - disable seeking
            slSeeking.IsEnabled = false;
            lbStatus.Text = "LIVE";
            lbStatus.TextColor = Colors.Red;
        }
    });
}
```

### 4. Stream Information and Diagnostics

Professional apps need to display stream metadata:

```csharp
// Get stream information
var videoInfo = await _source.GetVideoInfoAsync();
var audioInfo = await _source.GetAudioInfoAsync();

if (videoInfo != null && videoInfo.Count > 0)
{
    var vi = videoInfo[0];
    lblVideoInfo.Text = $"Video: {vi.Width}x{vi.Height} @ {vi.FrameRate:F2} fps, {vi.Codec}";
}
```

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Android
- Requires INTERNET permission in AndroidManifest.xml
- Hardware acceleration enabled by default
- Supports background playback with proper service implementation

### iOS/macOS
- Automatic integration with AVAudioSession
- AirPlay support out of the box
- Background modes configuration for audio playback

### Windows
- DirectX hardware acceleration
- Multi-window support
- Integration with Windows media controls

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Adaptive Bitrate**: The SDK automatically selects the best quality based on network conditions
2. **Buffer Management**: Configure buffer sizes based on your use case:
   ```csharp
   sourceSettings.BufferDuration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10);
   ```
3. **Hardware Decoding**: Always enabled by default, but can be controlled:
   ```csharp
   sourceSettings.HardwareAcceleration = true;
   ```

## Common HLS Streaming Scenarios

### Corporate Training Videos
Perfect for internal training platforms where content needs to work on employee devices regardless of platform.

### Live Event Streaming
Ideal for streaming conferences, webinars, or sports events with automatic quality adaptation.

### Educational Platforms
Great for e-learning applications where students might have varying internet speeds.

## Testing with Sample Streams

The app includes several test streams:
- **Mux Test Stream**: General HLS testing
- **Sintel Movie**: Open-source movie for VOD testing
- **Apple Sample**: Apple's official HLS examples
- **Tears of Steel**: Another open-source film

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Stream Won't Play
- Check URL accessibility (CORS for web-based streams)
- Verify HLS manifest format (.m3u8)
- Ensure network permissions are granted

### Audio/Video Sync Issues
- Usually indicates network problems
- Increase buffer size for poor connections
- Check if hardware decoder supports the codec

### Memory Usage
- The SDK automatically manages memory
- For long-running apps, implement periodic pipeline recreation

## Next Steps and Advanced Features

- **DRM Support**: Add Widevine/FairPlay for protected content
- **Offline Playback**: Download HLS streams for offline viewing
- **Analytics**: Track playback metrics and user engagement
- **Subtitles**: HLS supports multiple subtitle tracks
- **Multiple Audio Tracks**: Language selection for international content

## Conclusion

Building a cross-platform HLS streaming app doesn't have to be complex. With .NET MAUI and VisioForge Media Blocks SDK, you can create professional streaming applications that work everywhere your users are.

The complete source code is available in the VisioForge demos repository. The SDK offers a trial license for development, and the documentation includes many more examples for advanced scenarios.

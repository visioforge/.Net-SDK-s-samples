# Media Blocks SDK .Net - Simple Video Capture Demo

This SDK sample demonstrates how to create a simple video capture application on Android using the VisioForge Media Blocks SDK. It includes the setup of video and audio sources from the device's camera and microphone, respectively, and the rendering of live video previews. Additionally, it showcases the capability to start and stop recording, switch between different cameras, and handle permissions dynamically. The application leverages various blocks from the VisioForge framework, such as encoders for video and audio, a multiplexer for creating MP4 files, and specialized media blocks for audio and video processing, rendering, and source management.

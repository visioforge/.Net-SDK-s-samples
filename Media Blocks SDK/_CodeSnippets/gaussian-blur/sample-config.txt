# Sample Configuration for Gaussian Blur Demo
# ============================================

# Sample video files for testing (update with your paths):

# For testing standard videos:
# C:\Videos\sample_1080p.mp4
# C:\Videos\sample_720p.mp4

# Test URLs (if network sources are supported):
# https://www.sample-videos.com/video321/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_1mb.mp4

# Recommended test settings:
# - Blur Mode: Two-Pass (Standard) for best performance/quality balance
# - Blur Radius: 2.0-4.0 for subtle blur, 5.0-8.0 for strong blur
# - For real-time processing: Use Single-Pass mode with radius < 5.0

# Performance Notes:
# - Two-Pass Standard: ~60fps at 1080p on modern GPUs
# - Two-Pass HQ: ~45fps at 1080p on modern GPUs  
# - Single-Pass: ~90fps at 1080p on modern GPUs

# Shader Uniform Ranges:
# blur_radius: 0.0 - 10.0
# blur_strength: 0.0 - 1.0 (for single-pass)
# tex_width/tex_height: Set automatically from video dimensions

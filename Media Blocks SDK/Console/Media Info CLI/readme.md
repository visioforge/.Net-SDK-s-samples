# Media Blocks SDK .Net - Media Info CLI demo

The Media Info CLI SDK sample demonstrates a simple console application that uses the VisioForge MediaInfoReaderX library to read and display media file information. The program expects a file path as an input argument and prints the media file's details to the console. If no argument is provided, it prompts the user to specify an input file. The application showcases basic error handling by notifying the user when the specified media file cannot be read. This example serves as a quick start guide for developers looking to integrate media file analysis functionalities into their .NET applications.

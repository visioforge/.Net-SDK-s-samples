# VisioForge Media Player SDK .Net - Karaoke demo (C#/WinForms)

The Karaoke_Demo SDK sample demonstrates how to build a karaoke application using VisioForge's Media Blocks SDK in a Windows Forms application. This sample initializes the SDK, sets up a media pipeline for karaoke playback, including CD+G file support for lyrics display, and controls audio output devices. Users can load audio tracks, adjust the volume, and navigate through the song with a timeline. It also handles media playback events such as start, stop, and error handling, providing a robust foundation for developing full-featured karaoke software.
